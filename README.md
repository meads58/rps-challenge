# Challenge: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Using Ruby with the Sinatra framework to create my version of _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ to play on the web with the following features:

- the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared


- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
